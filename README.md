<h1>Single Stage Reduction Gearbox</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
Group project where we had to design a gearbox that transmit 18 hp from a motor running at 2100 rpm to an industrial machine running at 700 rpm. The gearbox has a maximum space of 13” x 20”, and all gears are solid spur gears made of steel. 
<br />
<br />
These 5 steps were considered:

1.  Material Selection: <br /> Identifying the appropriate steel grade for the gears, shafts and key, with sufficient mechanical properties (e.g. tensile strength, hardness, and fatigue resistance).

2.  Gear Design: <br /> Spur gears involve selecting the number of teeth, pitch diameter, and gear ratio. The gears must be designed to handle the required torque and power while considering factors such as pressure angle (20°), diametral pitch (6), and reliability (99%). The gearbox must also meet a design life of 14,000 hours.

3.  Shaft Design: <br /> Shaft 1 (pinion) and shaft 2 (gear) must be designed with adequate diameters, supported by bearings at locations A, B, C & D. Both shafts should be sized to handle the loads based on shear, bending moments, and torque diagrams. A factor of safety ≥ 2.5 for static design and ≥ 1.5 for fatigue design must be ensured, and endurance limits for fatigue calculations should be considered.

4.  Bearings Selection: <br /> Bearings must be selected to match the shaft dimensions and rotational speeds, ensuring smooth operation while withstanding the load.

5.  Safety Factors and Durability: <br /> The factor of safety of ≥ 2 for shaft diameters at critical points is required, and all components must be designed for a 99% reliability factor.
